Scenario:
the VPN client to access a customer works only on Windows, so we set it up and we want to share that connection with other colleagues.

1) First, we connect with the VPN client

2) We define the port proxying we want to make:
# requests made to our socket 172.16.33.13:80 will be transparently forwarded to the remote socket 10.151.51.205:80
# dafsharesrv.gruppo.autostrade.it
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=172.16.33.13 listenport=55555 connectaddress=10.151.51.205 connectport=80

# requests made to our socket 172.16.33.13:55555 will be transparently forwarded to the remote socket 10.151.51.203:80
# dafsrv.gruppo.autostrade.it
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=172.16.33.13 listenport=55555 connectaddress=10.151.51.203 connectport=80

3) Let's define an inbound firewall rule:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Test rule" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=80,55555 action=allow

4) Tell your collegues to modify their hosts file:
172.16.33.13 dafsrv.gruppo.autostrade.it
172.16.33.13 dafsharesrv.gruppo.autostrade.it

5) They'll connect to:
http://dafsrv.gruppo.autostrade.it:55555
http://dafsharesrv.gruppo.autostrade.it:80
